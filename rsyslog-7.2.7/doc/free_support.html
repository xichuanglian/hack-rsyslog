<h1>Free Services for Rsyslog</h1>
<p><i>A personal word from Rainer, the lead developer of rsyslog:</i>
<p><b>The rsyslog community provides ample free support resources. Please see our
<a href="troubleshoot.html">troubleshooting guide</a> to get started.</b></p>
<p>Every now and then I receive private mail with support questions. I appreciate
any feedback, but I must limit my resources so that I can help driver a great logging
system forward.
<p>To do so, I have decided not to reply to unsolicited support emails, at least not
with a solution (but rather a link to this page ;)). I hope this does not offend you. The
reason is quite simple: If I do personal support, you gain some advantage without
contributing something back. Think about it: if you ask your question on the public
forum or mailing list, other with the same problem can you and, most importantly, even
years later find your post (and the answer) and get the problem solved. So by
solving your issue in public, you help create a great community ressource and also
help your fellow users finding solutions quicker. In the long term, this
also contributes to improved code because the more questions users can find
solutions to themselves, the fewer I need to look at.
<p>But it comes even better: the rsyslog community is much broader than Rainer ;) - there
are helpful other members hanging around at the public places. They often answer
questions, so that I do not need to look at them (btw, once again a big "thank you", folks!).
And, more important, those folks have different background than me. So they often
either know better how to solve your problem (e.g. because it is distro-specific)
or they know how to better phrase it (after all, I like abstract terms and concepts ;)).
So you do yourself a favor if you use the public places.
<p>An excellent place to go to is the
<a href="http://kb.monitorware.com/rsyslog-f40.html">rsyslog forum</a> inside the
knowledge base (which in itself is a great place to visit!). For those used to
mailing lists, the
<a href="http://lists.adiscon.net/mailman/listinfo/rsyslog">rsyslog mailing list</a>
also offers excellent advise.
<p><b>Don't like to post your question in a public place?</b> Well, then you should
consider purchasing <a href="professional_support.html">rsyslog professional support</a>.
The fees are very low and help fund the project. If you use rsyslog seriously inside
a corporate environment, there is no excuse for not getting one of the support
packages ;)
<p>Of course, things are different when I ask you to mail me privately. I'll usually do
that when I think it makes sense, for example when we exchange debug logs.
<p>I hope you now understand the free support options and the reasoning for them.
I hope I haven't offended you with my words - this is not my intension. I just needed to
make clear why there are some limits on my responsiveness. Happy logging!

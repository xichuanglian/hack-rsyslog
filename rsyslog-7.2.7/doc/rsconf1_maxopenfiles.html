<h2>$MaxOpenFiles</h2>
<p><b>Available Since:</b> 4.3.0</p>
<p><b>Type:</b> global configuration directive</p>
<p><b>Default:</b> <i>operating system default</i></p>
<p><b>Description:</b></p>
<p>Set the maximum number of files that the rsyslog process can have open at any given
time. Note that this includes open tcp sockets, so this setting is the upper limit for
the number of open TCP connections as well. If you expect a large nubmer of concurrent
connections, it is suggested that the number is set to the max number connected plus 1000.
Please note that each dynafile also requires up to 100 open file handles.
<p>The setting is similar to running "ulimit -n number-of-files".
<p>Please note that depending on permissions and operating system configuration, the 
setrlimit() request issued by rsyslog may fail, in which case the previous limit is kept
in effect. Rsyslog will emit a warning message in this case.
<p><b>Sample:</b></p>
<p><code><b>$MaxOpenFiles 2000</b></code></p>
<p><b>Bugs:</b></p>
<p>For some reason, this settings seems not to work on all platforms. If you experience
problems, please let us know so that we can (hopefully) narrow down the issue.

<h1>sysklogd compatibility</h1>
<p>This is a part of the rsyslog.conf documentation.</p>
<a href="rsyslog_conf.html">Back to rsyslog.conf manual</a>
<p>Rsyslog supports standard sysklogd's configuration file format
and extends it. So in general, you can take a "normal" syslog.conf and
use it together with rsyslogd. It will understand everything. However,
to use most of rsyslogd's unique features, you need to add extended
configuration directives.</p>
<p>Rsyslogd supports the classical, selector-based rule lines.
They are still at the heart of it and all actions are initiated via
rule lines.
However, there are ample new directives, either in rsyslog traditional
format (starting with a dollar sign) or in RainerScript format. These
work together with sysklogd statements. A few select statements are
no longer supported and may generate error messages. They are mentioned
in the compatibility notes.

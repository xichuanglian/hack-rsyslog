<h2>$omfileForceChown</h2>
<p><b>Type:</b> global configuration directive</p>
<p><b>Parameter Values:</b> boolean (on/off, yes/no)</p>
<p><b>Available:</b> 4.7.0+, 5.3.0-5.8.x, <b>NOT</b> available in 5.9.x or higher</p>
<p><b>Note: this directive has been removed and is no longer available. The
documentation is currently being retained for historical reaons.</b> Expect
it to go away at some later stage as well.
<p><b>Default:</b> off</p>
<p><b>Description:</b></p>
<p>Forces rsyslogd to change the ownership for output files that already exist. Please note
that this tries to fix a potential problem that exists outside the scope of rsyslog. Actually,
it tries to fix invalid ownership/permission settings set by the original file creator.
<p>Rsyslog changes the ownership during initial execution with root privileges. When a privelege
drop is configured, privileges are dropped after the file owner ship is changed. Not that this currently
is a limitation in rsyslog's privilege drop code, which is on the TODO list to be removed. See Caveats
section below for the important implications.
<p><b>Caveats:</b></p>
<p>This directive tries to fix a problem that actually is outside the scope of rsyslog. As such,
there are a couple of restrictions and situations in which it will not work. <b>Users are strongly
encouraged to fix their system instead of turning this directive on</b> - it should only be used
as a last resort.
<p>At least in the following scenario, this directive will fail expectedly:
<p>It does not address
the situation that someone changes the ownership *after* rsyslogd has started.
Let's, for example, consider a log rotation script.
<ul>
<li>rsyslog is started
<li>ownership is changed
<li>privileges dropped
<li>log rotation (lr) script starts
<li>lr removes files
<li>lr creates new files with root:adm (or whatever else)
<li>lr HUPs rsyslogd
<li>rsyslogd closes files
<li>rsyslogd tries to open files
<li>rsyslogd tries to change ownership --&gt; fail as we are non-root now
<li>file open fails
</ul>

Please note that once the privilege drop code is refactored, this directive will
no longer work, because then privileges will be dropped before any action is performed,
and thus we will no longer be able to chown files that do not belong to the
user rsyslogd is configured to run under.

<p>So <b>expect the directive to go away</b>. It will not
be removed in version 4, but may disappear at any time for any version greater than 4.

<p><b>Sample:</b></p>
<p><code><b>$FileOwner loguser</b>
